        Traverses a tree and explodes it based on the given delimiter. Each node is split into a null

        was split using the delimiter ":" then the resulting node would have "*" as a parent with the
        children "A", "B", and "C". By default, this explodes each character in the label as a separate
        child node. Relies on split_node.
